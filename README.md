# My name Panagiotis Plagos and i'm a Cyberpsychology MSc student, with my first degree being in Psychology.
My main interests are in Human-Computer Interaction as well as in incorporating AI and machine learning methods in the exploration of complex psychological phenomena, such as cognitive processes, attentional mechanisms and social phenomena.
